## Server Integration

### Overview
Server integration is a critical aspect of our project, providing seamless connectivity and robust configuration options.

### Connection Methods
1. **Direct Connection**
   - Establish server connection using standard configuration
   - Supports both local and remote server environments

2. **Configuration Options**
   ```javascript
   const serverConfig = {
     host: 'localhost',
     port: 3000,
     protocol: 'https',
     timeout: 5000
   };
   ```

### Environment Setup
- Ensure required dependencies are installed
- Configure environment variables
- Validate server connection before deployment

### Best Practices
- Use secure, encrypted connections
- Implement proper error handling
- Log connection events for monitoring
- Regularly update server configurations

### Troubleshooting
- Check network connectivity
- Verify firewall and security group settings
- Validate authentication credentials
- Review server logs for detailed error information
